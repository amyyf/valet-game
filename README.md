# Valet

You are a valet driver at the biggest party in town. It's your job to ensure the safety of the guests' cars while they enjoy the party and promptly retrieve the cars for them when they return.

## Obstacles

- The speed at which the cars arrive
- the speed at which partygoers return
- the number of _spaces_ in the lot
- the speed of the parking attendant and the cars

## Scoring

The best scores come from quick retrieval of a car with no damage.
Slow timing reduces your tip.
Dings on the car cost the company insurance (and come out of your pay).
The valet service awards bonuses for meeting quota in a shift


## Gameplay

### Drop off
- You are a character walking around a lot
- you go to the entrance to pick up waiting cars
- The guest is given a ticket
- You drive a car to an open spot (or double park them)
- you take the keys to the lock box

### Pick up
- You are a character walking around a lot
- You pick up a ticket from a guest at the pick up
- you grab their keys
- you find their car (it's the one blinking)
- you drive it to the pickup

- Your pockets can carry 2 keys at a time
- Electric vehicles should go to charging stations for extra tip

## Ideas
- unlock the car
- start the car
- dirty cars need to be washed
- smelly cars need to be vacuumed
- joy ride
- guests say what time they expect to be back (to organize cars better, or have their car ready for them)
